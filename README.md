# Movies-ETL
Analysis of movie data with Python, PostgreSQL, and Jupyter Notebook

## Resources
Data Source: [movies_metadata.csv, ratings.csv, wikipedia-movies.json](https://github.com/monsecc01/Movies-ETL/blob/b20455cd507aea2bfe39baf9ff54ea17c35e8acf/Resources.zip)

Software: Python 3.9, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook

## Overview of Movies ETL:
The purpose of this analysis is to create an automated pipeline that takes new data, transforms data appropriately, and loads data into existing tables. We will be refactoring code to allow the following files to be analyzed automatically and added to a PostgreSQL database:
* Wikipedia data
* Kaggle metadata
* MovieLens rating data
